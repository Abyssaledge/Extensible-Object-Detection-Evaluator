# A simple and extensible object detection evaluator in COCO style

## Features 
- Extensible user interfaces to deal with different data formats.
- Support customized evaluation breakdowns, e.g., object size in COCO, difficulty in KITTI, velocity and range in Waymo.
- Interface for general matching scores, e.g. 2D IoU, 3D rotated IoU, center distance.
- Support widely-used metrics like AP, AR and customized metrics like average regression errors, average IoUs, etc. 
- Purely based on Python, easy to develop your customized metrics.

## Installation
- `pip install treelib`
- Clone this repo and run `pip install .` in the cloned directory, or `pip install -e .` if you want to modify the source code.

## Prepare predictions and groundtruth
You need to define a function to read the predictions and groundtruth. 
```
def read_prediction(path):
    ...
    return results
```
where the `results` is a dictionary using sample_id (image_id) as key and each item is a dictionary contains at least `box`, `score` and `type`:
```
# ndarray in shape of [N, C], where N is the number of bboxes in this sample and C is the box dimension
boxes = ... 

# ndarray in shape [N,]
scores = ... 

# ndarray in shape of [N,]
types = ... 

results[sample_id] = dict(box=boxes, score=scores, type=types)
```
And you need to define another function to read groundtruth as the same way. The items of returned dict contain at least `box` and `type`.

## Customize matching score calculator
If you are going to evaluate a 2D detector, you may want to define a 2D IoU function, which will be automatically used in the matching process. 

```
def iou_2d(box1, box2):
    # box1 in shape of [N1, 4], which is the box item defined above.
    # box2 in shape of [N2, 4], which is the box item defined above.
    
    iou_matrix = ... # [N1, N2]
    return iou_matrix
```
You are free to define any other matching score calculators (e.g., 3D IoU), as long as keeping the same function prototype. For example:
```
def customized_iou_calculator(box1, box2):
    # box1 in shape of [N1, box_dim]
    # box2 in shape of [N2, box_dim]

    iou_matrix = ... # [N1, N2]
    return iou_matrix
```

## Customize breakdowns if you like
To correctly use customized breakdowns, here we define two kinds of breakdowns: `separable breakdowns` and `inseparable breakdowns`.

`Separable breakdowns` indicate those can be used to partition prediction set and groundtruth set before the matching process. For example, `object category` is a typical separable breakdown. We usually first partition the predictions and groundtruth and only pass the predictions and groundtruth in the same category to the evaluator.

`Inseparable breakdowns` indicate those can **NOT** be simply used to partition prediction set and groundtruth set before the matching process. A typical inseparable breakdown is `object size` in COCO. We deal with those inseparable breakdowns in the matching process.  

Follow the following step to add the breakdowns you need:

### 1. Define breakdown function
For example, if you want to evaluate conditioned on vehicle length in Waymo:
```
def waymo_length_breakdown(object_item):
    # the object item is defined in Sec. prepare-predictions-and-groundtruth
    return object_item['box'][:, 4] # 4th number indicates vehicle length
```
### 2. Define breakdown value
If you want to add category and size as breakdowns in COCO:
```
def get_object_type(object_item):
    return object_item['type'] # 4th number indicates vehicle length

def get_object_size(object_item):
    box = object_item['box']
    return (box[:, 2] * box[:, 3]) ** 0.5  # height x width

separable_breakdown_dict = {'type': [None, 'person', 'bus']} # None means evaluate over all categories.
inseparable_breakdown_dict = {'size': [None, (0, 32), (32, 96), (96, 1e10)]} # None means evaluate over all sizes.

separable_breakdown_func_dict = {'type': get_object_type, 'size': get_object_size}
```

## Launch evaluation
### 1. Put the pre-defined stuff into a params object
For example in Waymo:
```
from od_evaluation.params import BaseParam
class WaymoBaseParam(BaseParam):

    def __init__(self, pd_path, gt_path, interval=10, update_sep=None, update_insep=None):
        super().__init__(pd_path, gt_path, interval, update_sep, update_insep)
        self.iouThrs = [0.7, 0.5]
    
    def add_breakdowns(self):
        self.separable_breakdowns = {
            'type':('Vehicle', 'Pedestrian', 'Cyclist'), 
            'range':([0, 30], [30, 50], [50, 80], None), # None means the union of all ranges
        }
        self.inseparable_breakdowns = {'length':[(0, 4), (4, 8), (8, 20)]}
        self.breakdown_func_dict = {'range': get_waymo_object_range, 'length': get_waymo_object_length}
    
    def add_iou_function(self):
        self.iou_calculate_func = get_waymo_iou_matrix

    def add_input_function(self):
        self.read_prediction_func = read_waymo_object
        self.read_groundtruth_func = read_waymo_object
```
Note that you must implement `add_breakdowns`, `add_iou_function` and `add_input_function` after inherit `BaseParam`.
### 2. Begin Evaluation
```
from od_evaluation.eval import Evaluator
pd_path = xxx
gt_path = xxx
params = WaymoBaseParam(pd_path, gt_path)
e = Evaluator(params)
e.run()
```
## Output
We use treelib to format the evaluation results, where multiple breakdowns are nested:
